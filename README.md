# tof-coding

This repository contains functions to generate coding matrices often used in time-of-flight imaging. 

Currently, this repository includes code to generate the following coding matrices

1. Fourier-based Coding: Coding matrix based on the Fourier codes (i.e., rows from the DFT matrix)
2. Gray Coding: Binary coding matrix based on gray codes
3. Hamiltonian Coding: This is a continuous gray coding matrix where the values on the transitions between 0 to 1 or -1 to 1 are linearly interpolated.
